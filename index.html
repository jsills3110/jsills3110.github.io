                    If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.
                    Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. In nature, dead trees are just
                    as normal as live trees. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Zip. That easy. Working it up and
                    down, back and forth.
                </p>
