                Hey there, welcome to my basic portfolio!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some interesting facts about me: I own a chinchilla named Kia, I LARP (live action roleplay)
                in my spare time, I enjoy video games, I competed in dairy cow competitions in high school, and my
                favorite color is purple.

                Still want to know more? I love Bob Ross, I often fall asleep to his youtube videos at night, because
                his voice is calming. Also, the paintings he creates are beautiful, even though I'm asleep by the time
                he finishes them at the end of the episodes.

                One of my proudest accomplishments is completing the Wonderland Trail in 2017. The Wonderland Trail
                circumnavigates Mt. Rainier. It's approximately 93 miles and includes 22,000 feet of elevation gain
                and loss. Myself and two friends backpacked the trail in 11 days; it was physically and emotionally
                grueling, but we saw some of the most amazing views. Views that you can only see if you walk to them.
