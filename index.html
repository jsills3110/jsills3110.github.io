                    Hey there, welcome to my basic portfolio! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some interesting facts about me: I own a chinchilla named Kia, I LARP (live action roleplay) 
                    in my spare time, I enjoy video games, I competed in dairy cow competitions in high school, and my 
                    favorite color is purple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still want to know more? I love Bob Ross, I often fall asleep to his youtube videos at night.

                    If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.
                    Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. In nature, dead trees are just
                    as normal as live trees. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Zip. That easy. Working it up and
                    down, back and forth.

                    That easy. And maybe a little bush lives there. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
                    Play with the angles. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.
